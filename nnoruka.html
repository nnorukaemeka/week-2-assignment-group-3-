#MY CODE PLATEAU EXPERIENCE So far, so good... It all became a reality when I attended the Code Plateau orientation that was held at the Government house. The first week of the training was more of getting acquainted with the training centre (NHub), the instructors, and other trainees. Though the lectures were so bored especially as topics like slack, hardware/software, operating systems, internet, word processing, programming languages and algorithm were revised. In contrast, just in week two, the ride became fun and adventurous as Git/Github topic was disintegrated. I am glad to be given this opportunity to show case this very Git skill the best way possible. @nnorukaemeka.
