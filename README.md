This is an assessment to test how well the Code Plateau (Group-3) participants understood the lectures on git and github topic. Each participant is to create a repository on Github, create a file with name.html on his/her local machine, write his/her experience so far on the training, save and git push the file to the repository created on Github. He/She also is to invite other group members as collaborators to contribute to the project by creating a file explaining their experience, then git push it and open pull request.
